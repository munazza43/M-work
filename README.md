   - **Habitat**: Primarily found in sub-Saharan Africa, with a small population in the Gir Forest of India.

### 2. **Social Structure**
   - Lions are unique among big cats for their social behavior; they live in groups called prides, which usually consist of related females, their cubs, and a few males.

### 3. **Physical Characteristics**
   - Males are distinguished by their impressive manes, which can vary in color and size. The mane serves as a sign of maturity and health.
   - Lions are large, muscular cats with a strong build, typically weighing between 330 to 550 pounds.

### 4. **Diet and Hunting**
   - They are carnivorous and primarily hunt large herbivores like wildebeests, zebras, and buffalo.
   - Lions often hunt in groups, using teamwork to take down their prey.

### 5. **Reproduction**
   - Lionesses usually give birth to 1-4 cubs after a gestation period of about 110 days.
   - Cubs are born blind and rely on their mothers for protection and nourishment.

### 6. **Conservation Status**
   - Lions are classified as vulnerable by the IUCN Red List due to habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching. Conservation efforts are underway in various regions to protect their populations.

### 7. **Cultural Significance**

   Lions are carnivorous predators, and their diet primarily consists of large herbivores. Here are some key points about what lions eat:

### Main Prey
1. **Ungulates**: Lions typically hunt animals like:
   - **Wildebeests**
   - **Zebras**
   - **Buffalo**
   - **Antelopes** (e.g., impalas, gazelles)
   - **Hippopotamuses** (occasionally)

2. **Scavenging**: While lions are skilled hunters, they will also scavenge from other predators, particularly when food is scarce.

### Hunting Behavior
- Lions often hunt in groups, using teamwork to surround and isolate their prey.
- They tend to hunt at night or during cooler parts of the day to conserve energy and avoid the heat.

### Feeding Habits
- After a successful hunt, lions may eat quickly to protect their kill from scavengers like hyenas or vultures.
- A pride may consume a large amount of meat in a single sittingâ€”sometimes over 100 pounds (45 kg) at a time.

### Water Needs
- Lions can go for several days without drinking water, but they do require water for survival and will drink from rivers or lakes when available.
